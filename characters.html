    <h1>Characters</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2>Major Motoko Kusanagi</h2>
    <div class="right"><img src="images/kusanagi.jpg" alt="Major Kusanagi brings da pain" width="500" height="275" />
        <p>The main character of GITS, Major Motoko Kusanagi, is a cyborg, having had a terrible accident befall her as a child that ultimately required that she use a full-body prosthesis to house her cyberbrain. This high level of cyberization, however, opens the brain up to potential attacks from highly skilled hackers. The Major is proficient in various types of martial arts, hand-to-hand combat, weapons wielding, and hacking.</p>
    </div>
    <hr>
    <h2>Batou</h2>
    <img src="images/batou.jpg" alt="Batou is unimpressed" width="500" />
    <div class="left">
        <p> Recruited from the Rangers, the second best melee fighter in Section 9, he is the second in command under Major Motoko Kusanagi. Batou keeps his life away from work mostly unknown. He also gave his favorite Tachikoma an unapproved, non-synthetic oil until the Major caught him. In the first Stand Alone Complex series, the Laughing Man hacked into his eyes so that Batou could not see him. He often uses up his paycheck buying muscle training equipment for the upper body, which others find useless, considering his extensive number of cyborg parts (mainly torso and arms). In the first season of Stand Alone Complex, it is inferred that he uses it to remind himself of who he is, despite his cyberization, much like the watch the Major wears.</p>
    </div>
    <hr>
    <h2>Lt. Col. Daisuke Aramaki</h2>
    <img src="images/aramaki.jpg" alt="Aramaki sits and sizes" width="500" />
    <div class="right">
        <p>The Chief Executive Director of Public Security Section 9. In Stand Alone Complex, Lt. Col. Aramaki is a strict chief, and is informally referred to by Section 9 agents as the "old ape" (most likely because in the original manga he was drawn with a face that appeared to be half monkey, half man). Even so, he is fiercely loyal to the members of Section 9, and often puts his own career on the line to ensure the survival of the rest of his team. It is revealed in Mamoru Oshii's Ghost In The Shell that Aramaki, together with Togusa, are the only fully human members of Section 9; (aside from a cyberbrain).</p>
    </div>
    <hr>
    <h2>Togusa</h2>
    <img src="images/togusa.jpg" alt="Togusa ain't playin" width="500" />
    <div class="left">
        <p>In "<em>Stand Alone Complex</em>" it is stated that he is the only member of Section 9 who has not undergone cybernetic replacement in some manner as he had been referred to as 'natural'. In the movie it is claimed that it is precisely because of his lack of cybernetic enhancements that he was chosen for Kusanagi's team. In the manga, it is unclear as to what extent he has undergone cybernization, although in both the manga, anime and movies he has a cyberbrain like all other members. Togusa is 27 years old and is 5' 10 inches in height. In the Solid State Society movie, he is squad leader of the now expanded Section 9, after the Major's departure and Batou's refusal of the position. It is also stated in Solid State Society that Togusa had finally undergone cyberization, the extent of which, however, is unknown.</p>
    </div>
    <hr>
    <h2>Ishikawa</h2>
    <img src="images/ishikawa.jpg" alt="Delivery for Mr. Ishikawa" width="500" />
    <div class="right">
        <p>Ishikawa is the information warfare/technology specialist in Public Security Section 9. It has not been stated in the series thus far as to the degree that he has been cybernetically augmented, though character dialogue (and his long recovery time from an injury) suggests that he is one of the least augmented members of Section 9. His appearance is characterized by a large beard and perpetually unkempt hair, and he is the oldest of Section 9's field operatives. He formerly served with Kusanagi and Batou in South America when they were with the Ground Self-Defense Forces in the Japanese UN contingent. He was one of the earliest members recruited to be in Section 9 and seems to know the Major and her dislikes quite well. He is shown as being in charge of a pachinko parlor called Parlor Ishikawa, and on occasion uses the cyberbrains of the old men who play there to complete particularly heavy data gathering (though it seems the men suffer no ill effects or are even aware of their situation, and are in fact 'paid' with wins at pachinko for use of their 'processor' time). Ishikawa is the most seemingly laid-back member of the unit.</p>
    </div>
    <hr>
    <h2>Saito</h2>
    <img src="images/saito.jpg" alt="Saito has his eye on you" width="500" />
    <div class="left">
        <p>Among the members of Section 9, Saito is regarded as one of the least cyberized. He can handle any automatic firearm with deadly accuracy and precision, but his primary role is as the unit's tactical sniper. Saito's left arm is cybernetic, allowing him to support and steady extremely large sniper weapons with superhuman skill. His left eye was replaced with the "<em>Hawkeye</em>", a prosthetic eye that interfaces with satellites to allow for shots of incredible accuracy. The Hawkeye, however, can be hacked, as it is in Episode 2 of SAC. It is impossible for Saito to escape hacking by going into autistic mode because he needs to maintain his Hawkeye's satellite uplink. Saito is also valued for his ability to think like enemy snipers; on two separate occasions his ability at determining sniping locations impacted Section 9's actions.</p>
    </div>
    <hr>
    <h2>Borma</h2>
    <img src="images/borma.jpg" alt="Borma got pinholes" width="500" />
    <div class="right">
        <p>Borma is Section 9's resident explosives specialist. He is the only Section 9 operative with similar height and enhanced strength to Batou. He also has optical implant eyes of a similar general design to Batou's, though his optics are a different color and might be another model with different capabilities. Both his eyes and his baldness are his trademark features. In addition to his role as Section 9's explosives specialist, Borma often handles the task of rear support. In most assignments, he's the only member to carry heavy weaponry. He also works as the team's resident cyberviral warfare expert, often developing vaccines for viruses within minutes of their creation. He is usually teamed with either Saito for sniping duties, Paz for general operations and Ishikawa for cyberweb research and viral warfare.</p>

    <h2>Paz</h2>
    <img src="images/pazu.jpg" alt="Pazu looks very annoyed" width="500" />
    <div class="left">
        <p>AKA "Pazu", is an investigator in Section 9. Before joining Public Security Section 9, Paz was rumored by various police circles to have been a gangster in several yakuza groups in Japan. Paz is the backup "jack-of-all-trades" for the field agents and is also a known chain smoker within the unit. Upon his first encounter with the Major, he remarked, "I never sleep with the same woman twice." He uses a folding knife in combat.</p>
    </div>
    <hr>
    <h2>Tachikoma</h2>
    <img src="images/tachikoma.jpg" alt="Excited Tachikoma" width="500" />
    <div class="right">
        <p>In the various editions of Ghost in the Shell, Section 9 utilizes different types of "multi-legged tanks", all of which seem to act like children. The Tachikoma are "think" tanks implemented by Section 9 in the Stand Alone Complex series (as well as the Rise prequels) which are commissioned with a variety of tasks that make efficient use of their AI. These tasks range anywhere from recon work to ghost hacking, data mining, and combat.</p>
