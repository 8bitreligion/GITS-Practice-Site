    <h1>Ghost In The Shell</h1>
    <div>
        <p>Primarily set in the mid-twenty-first century in the fictional hyper-futuristic Japanese city of Niihama, Ghost In The Shell follows the exploits of Major Motoko Kusanagi within the privatized counterterrorism/ military-espionage organization known as Public Security Section 9. In this post-cyberpunk iteration of a possible future, computer technology has advanced to the point that many members of the public possess cyberbrains, technology that allows them to interface their biological brain with various networks. The level of cyberization varies from simple minimal interfaces to almost complete replacement of the brain with cybernetic parts, in cases of severe trauma. This can also be combined with various levels of prosthesis, with a fully prosthetic body enabling a person to become a cyborg.</p>
